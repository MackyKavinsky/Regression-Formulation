# Regression-Formulation
Objective: To find how much clicks that we could get based on the marketing spending?

The target of this experiment/project is to find the weight of RM1 bring to each of the social media platform. The main reason I'm using this approach is because :
- The data provided is time-series base, which is continuous data.
- The weight/coefficient would be the easiest way to explain to the business users who new to the machine learning algorithm.

The excel file is included for testing.


# Next Step:

- To split the data into training/testing (for validation, and required new dataset).
- To approach the objective from other view (Random Forest Regressor, SVM or XGBoost).
